# Documentation Policy

## Objective

Keep documentation continuously aligned with product and code reality.

## Mandatory Rules

- Every change requires documentation review.
- Every meaningful decision requires a decision-log entry.
- If code changes behavior, docs must be updated in the same PR/commit.
- If architecture changes, architecture docs must be updated immediately.

## Decision Logging

Record decisions in `docs/engineering/DECISION_LOG.md` using this format:

- Date
- Context
- Decision
- Consequences
- Follow-up actions

## Completion Gate

A task is not done if documentation is outdated.
